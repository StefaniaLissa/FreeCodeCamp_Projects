      <p> Disney was a shy, self-deprecating and insecure man in private but adopted a warm and outgoing public persona. He had high standards and high expectations of those with whom he worked. </p>

      <p>Disney attended McKinley High School in Chicago, where he took drawing and photography classes and was a contributing cartoonist for the school paper. At night, he took courses at the Art Institute of Chicago.
        In 1919, Disney pursued a career as a newspaper artist. His brother Roy got him a job at the Pesmen-Rubin Art Studio. From there, Disney worked at the Kansas City Film Ad Company, where he made commercials based on cutout animation.
        Around this time, Disney began experimenting with a camera, doing hand-drawn cel animation. He decided to open his own animation business. By 1923, however, the studio had become burdened with debt, and Disney was forced to declare bankruptcy.

        Disney and his brother Roy moved to Hollywood with cartoonist Ub Iwerks in 1923, and there the three began the Disney Brothers' Cartoon Studio. The company soon changed its name to Walt Disney Studios, at Roy’s suggestion.</p>

        <p> Disney’s first successful film starring Mickey Mouse was a sound-and-music-equipped animated short called Steamboat Willie.</p>

      <p> It opened at the Colony Theater in New York November 18, 1928. Sound had just made its way into film, and Disney was the voice of Mickey.

      <p>One of Disney Studio’s most popular cartoons, Flowers and Trees (1932), was the first to be produced in color and to win an Oscar. In 1933, The Three Little Pigs and its title song "Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?" became a theme for the country in the midst of the Great Depression.</p>

        By 1934, Disney had become dissatisfied with producing formulaic cartoon shorts, and believed a feature-length cartoon would be more profitable. His first full-length animated film was Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, which premiered in Los Angeles on December 21, 1937.
        Disney's animators developed a multiplane camera which allowed drawings on pieces of glass to be set at various distances from the camera, creating an illusion of depth.
        The studio made a loss on both pictures and was deeply in debt by the end of February 1941. In response to the financial crisis, Disney and his brother Roy started the company's first public stock offering in 1940, and implemented heavy salary cuts. In 1941 a setback for the company occurred when Disney animators went on strike.
        Disney's $17 million Disneyland theme park opened on July 17, 1955, in Anaheim, California, on what was once an orange grove. He was also involved in planning the 1959 Moscow Fair, the 1960 Winter Olympics, and the 1964 New York World's Fair.</p>
      <p><a id="tribute-link" href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney" targer="_blank">Walt Disney</a> was diagnosed with lung cancer in 1966 and died on December 15, 1966, at the age of 65.</p>
